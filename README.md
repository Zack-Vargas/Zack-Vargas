I build web systems that favor clarity, longevity, and sane defaults.

Most of my work lives in private repos.  
What’s public here is foundational, experimental, or intentionally unfinished.

### Current focus
- CMS architectures that don’t collapse under real use
- React systems built for constraints, not demos
- Practical AI integrations — less hype, more wiring

### How I think
- Simplicity scales better than cleverness
- Good abstractions age well
- Tools should disappear once they’re working

### Selected work
- CMS & React boilerplates used in production
- Internal tooling and experiments
- Forks maintained as research, not trophies
