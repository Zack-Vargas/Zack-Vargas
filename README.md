## Hi, I’m Zack 👋

I build web systems with a bias toward clarity, longevity, and sane defaults.

Most of my work lives in private repos.  
What’s public here is either foundational, experimental, or deliberately unfinished.

### Current focus
- Modern CMS architectures
- React-based systems with real-world constraints
- Practical AI integrations (less hype, more wiring)

### How I think
- Simplicity scales better than cleverness
- Good abstractions age well
- Tools should disappear once they’re working

### Selected work
- Astro, Next, Vercel
- Internal tooling and experiments
- Forks used as research, not trophies
